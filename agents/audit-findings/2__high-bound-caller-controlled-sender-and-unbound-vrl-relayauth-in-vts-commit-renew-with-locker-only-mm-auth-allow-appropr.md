[High] Bound-caller-controlled sender and unbound VRL RelayAuth in VTS commit/renew with locker-only MM auth allow appropriation of VRL-backed issuance

# Description

A bound endpoint can front-run a victim’s VRL commit/renew, then use the direct CoreHook path to add liquidity under that commit with only [locker==advancer equality](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.sol#L718-L737), causing LCC issuance to be minted to the attacker’s bound router and enabling unwrap/queued claims to the attacker.

In [VTSCommitLib._resolveSignalSender](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L462-L470), any caller that is bound for a factory may supply an arbitrary sender; unbound callers must use sender==caller. [VRLSignalManager.verifyLiquiditySignal/verifyLiquiditySignalRelayed authorize based only on sender matching mmState.owner or mmState.advancer](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L79-L84) and valid proof/[EIP-712 RelayAuth](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L30-L36), but the signed struct does not bind the authorization to the relayer/factory ([verifyLiquiditySignalRelayed](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L171-L183)). As a result, a bound endpoint can front-run a victim’s commit/renew by reusing the victim’s liquiditySignal (and authSig for relayed path) to create/refresh a commit. Then, via the direct CoreHook→VTS path, [VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.validateMMOperation authorizes MM operations if the owner is bound and hookData.locker equals the commit’s advancer (equality only, no per-operation signature)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.sol#L718-L737). During add-liquidity, [VTSPositionMMOpsLib._handleLiquidityIncrease issues LCC to p.owner (the bound router)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSPositionMMOpsLib.sol#L422-L438), not to the advancer/locker, allowing the attacker to receive LCC and subsequently unwrap to underlying or accrue durable queued settlement claims. This is not NFT theft via MMPositionManager (which still requires the locker to be the authorized sender), but the attacker does not need the NFT because the direct CoreHook path suffices. Issued amounts remain bounded by the VRL backing check ([issuedValue <= signalValue + settledValue](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L160-L177)), but the misallocation of issuance and claims persists.

# Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [High] The attacker causes LCC to be minted to their own bound router and can unwrap to underlying or create durable queued settlement claims payable to themselves, representing a direct, material misallocation of principal-like value (incorrectly minted/created relative to intended authorization).

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Medium] Exploitation requires control of a bound endpoint (a privileged but plausible role in multi-integrator deployments) and timely front-running or access to off-chain VRL leaves; no cryptographic break or rare states are needed.

# Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
A malicious bound router observes a victim’s commitSignalRelayed in the mempool, copies liquiditySignal and authSig, calls VTSOrchestrator.commitSignalRelayed with sender=mmState.owner/advancer, creating a live commit; then performs add-liquidity via CoreHook with locker=advancer, causing LCC to be issued to the attacker’s router and enabling unwrap/queued settlement to the attacker.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker controls a bound endpoint (router) for the relevant market factory
- (b). Victim has a fresh, valid VRL liquiditySignal and proof (non-expired)
- (c). PoolManager is unlocked; VTSOrchestrator is registered as VRL submitter
- (d). Attacker can observe the mempool (victim’s commitSignalRelayed is visible) before confirmation

### Scenario 2.
A malicious bound router front-runs a victim’s renewSignalRelayed for an existing commitId by copying liquiditySignal/authSig from the mempool, successfully renews the commit, then adds liquidity via CoreHook with locker=advancer, resulting in LCC issuance to the attacker and subsequent unwrap/queued claims.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker controls a bound endpoint (router) for the relevant market factory
- (b). There exists a victim commitId nearing expiry and a fresh valid liquiditySignal for renewal
- (c). PoolManager is unlocked; VTSOrchestrator is registered as VRL submitter
- (d). Attacker can observe the mempool (victim’s renewSignalRelayed is visible) before confirmation

### Scenario 3.
A malicious bound router uses an off-chain observed VRL liquiditySignal (no mempool race), calls VTSOrchestrator.commitSignal with sender=mmState.owner/advancer to create a commit, and then adds liquidity via CoreHook with locker=advancer, receiving LCC issuance to itself and converting it to underlying or queued claims.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker controls a bound endpoint (router) for the relevant market factory
- (b). Victim’s fresh VRL liquiditySignal (and proof) is observable off-chain
- (c). PoolManager is unlocked; VTSOrchestrator is registered as VRL submitter

## [Medium] Missing per‑MM signature verification in VRLSignalManager/ECDSA verifier causes forced low‑backing renewals and potential seizure of victim positions

### Description

On-chain verification accepts a market maker (MM) state solely based on a [TSS-signed VRL root](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/verifiers/ECDSASignatureSignalVerifier.sol#L45-L51) and [Merkle inclusion](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/verifiers/ECDSASignatureSignalVerifier.sol#L40-L42), plus [sender gating that relies on leaf-embedded owner/advancer](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L114-L118). The [LiquiditySignal.mmSignature](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/types/Commit.sol#L20) is never checked, so if the off-chain VRL root includes a malicious leaf, attackers can [renew commits](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L318-L323) with low reserves/short expiry and open RFS leading to seizure and principal loss.

VRLSignalManager.verifyLiquiditySignal only enforces: (1) [Merkle inclusion of mmState in a TSS-signed root](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/verifiers/ECDSASignatureSignalVerifier.sol#L40-L42) ([verified by ECDSASignatureSignalVerifier](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/verifiers/ECDSASignatureSignalVerifier.sol#L45-L51)) and (2) that the provided [sender equals mmState.owner or mmState.advancer from the leaf](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L114-L118). [LiquiditySignal.mmSignature](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/types/Commit.sol#L20) (a per-MM signature) is not verified anywhere. VTSCommitLib._renewSignalInternal then [overwrites stored commit.mmState and commit.expiresAt if mmState.owner matches the stored commit owner and the sender equals leaf.advancer](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L318-L323). Consequently, if the off-chain VRL root-building pipeline or its TSS signer includes a malicious leaf that sets advancer to the attacker and owner to the victim, the attacker can perform a renewal that stores arbitrarily low reserves or very short expiry. Subsequent commitment checkpoints compute insufficient backing ([or zero when expired](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L365-L373)), opening RFS and eventually enabling seizure via [CheckpointLibrary.isSeizable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/Checkpoint.sol#L53-L59), causing principal loss for the victim.

### Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [High] Victim MM positions can be driven into RFS and seized, resulting in direct, material loss of principal via seizure accounting.

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Low] Exploitation requires the off-chain VRL/TSS root-building integration to include a malicious/misconfigured leaf; on-chain checks alone cannot be bypassed.

### Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
Forced low-backing renewal: A malicious VRL leaf (owner=victimOwner, advancer=attackerEOA, tiny reserves, short expiry, nonce above victim’s mmNonce) is TSS-signed and included. The attacker, as the MMPM locker, calls renew; VRLSignalManager accepts (sender==advancer), and VTSCommitLib updates the [stored commit to the low-reserve/short-expiry state](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L318-L323). Next commitment checkpoints detect insufficient backing or [expiration](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L365-L373), open RFS, and after grace the victim’s positions become seizable, causing principal loss.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Off-chain VRL root builder/TSS includes a malicious leaf signed into the batch root
- (b). Malicious leaf fields: mmState.owner == victimOwner; mmState.advancer == attackerEOA; mmState.reserves very low; mmState.expiryAt near-term; signal.nonce > mmNonce[victimOwner]
- (c). VTSOrchestrator is registered as submitter (normal deployment) and MMPM is a bound endpoint able to forward attackerEOA as sender
- (d). Victim has an existing commit and active positions linked to it

### Scenario 2.
mmNonce grief + forced expiry: The attacker repeatedly submits malicious renewals (each with increasing nonce and very short expiry). mmNonce[victimOwner] is advanced, blocking the victim’s future legitimate renewals (nonce too low). With very short expiry, the commit soon expires; checkpoints treat backing as [zero](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/43c9a5549e2b848453d63ca8246ed0db39b18c3b/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L365-L373) and open RFS, making the victim’s positions seizable after grace.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Off-chain VRL root builder/TSS repeatedly includes malicious leaves for victimOwner with attackerEOA as advancer and increasing nonces
- (b). Each malicious leaf has very short expiryAt to force rapid expiration
- (c). Victim relies on timely renewals; mmNonce[victimOwner] is advanced by accepted malicious renewals
- (d). Stored commit eventually expires; checkpoints run with zero backing
