[Medium] Removal of native-only contract-recipient restriction in LiquidityHub._assertQueueRecipientServiceable causes unrecoverable ETH in MMQueueCustodian and reserve depletion

# Description

Allowing [contract recipients for native-backed LCC deficit queues](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L1020-L1044) enables ProxyHook exact-input swaps to [route deficits to MMQueueCustodian contracts](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/ProxyHook.sol#L281-L286), after which [permissionless settlement pushes ETH into custodians](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L931-L938) without beneficiary-ledger entries, permanently stranding funds and depleting market-derived reserve.

The PR removed the native-only EOA restriction in [LiquidityHub._assertQueueRecipientServiceable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L1020-L1044) for queueForTransferRecipient on native-backed LCCs. ProxyHook’s exact-input path lets the swapper set any deficitRecipient, then [transfers market-derived LCC to that address and calls queueForTransferRecipient](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/ProxyHook.sol#L281-L286). If the recipient is an MMQueueCustodian, the admission checks pass because the transfer pre-populates the custodian’s market-derived balance and the custodian is not EXEMPT/DEX by default. However, the custodian’s beneficiary-scoped ledger (_queuedLcc) is only written via MMPositionManager-controlled calls (record or unwrapLccViaHub), which do not occur on the ProxyHook path. Later, anyone can call [LiquidityHub.processSettlementFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L931-L938) to settle the custodian’s queue: settlement burns the custodian’s LCC and [pushes native ETH directly to the custodian](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/libraries/LiquidityHubLib.sol#L585-L601) ([its payable receive() succeeds](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/MMQueueCustodian.sol#L36-L38)). Since no ledger entry exists, MMPositionManager cannot forward underlying to any beneficiary via [collectUnderlyingToBeneficiary](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/MMQueueCustodian.sol#L128-L137), leaving ETH permanently stranded. This drains the market-derived reserve and creates a dead-end native settlement sink that did not exist on native lanes before the PR change.

# Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [High] Settlement permanently transfers mobilised market-derived ETH from the Hub to custodians with no beneficiary ledger, creating a durable, unrecoverable loss of principal funds and impairing core settlement functionality.

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Low] Exploitation is primarily griefing: the attacker incurs swap costs and gains no direct economic benefit, relying on intentional, loss-making behavior rather than rational profit incentives.

# Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
One-off native reserve drain into a custodian sink: the attacker sets an MMQueueCustodian as the deficit recipient in a [ProxyHook exact-input swap](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/ProxyHook.sol#L281-L286), queues a deficit to the custodian, then calls [processSettlementFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L931-L938) to push ETH into the custodian, which cannot be forwarded to any beneficiary due to missing ledger entries.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). A native-backed LCC market exists
- (b). At least one MMQueueCustodian has been deployed for an NFT recipient (discoverable via [MMPositionManager.custodianFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/84f5c03842082bd9984dbfd2174305fbd7ce4aaa/contracts/evm/src/MMPositionManager.sol#L88-L92))
- (c). ProxyHook exact-input swap is publicly accessible
- (d). The requested output exceeds in-market underlying balance to create a deficit
- (e). Liquidity is mobilised so settlement can occur (reserve available)

### Scenario 2.
Systematic multi-market degradation: the attacker enumerates custodian addresses across multiple native-backed markets, repeatedly routes deficits to those custodians via ProxyHook, and settles them permissionlessly, cumulatively stranding ETH across custodians and depleting reserves.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Multiple native-backed LCC markets exist with deployed MMQueueCustodians
- (b). Attacker can enumerate custodian addresses (public mapping or events)
- (c). ProxyHook exact-input swaps are publicly accessible
- (d). Deficits can be created by sizing inputs above available underlying balances
- (e). Mobilised reserves occur over time enabling repeated settlements

### Scenario 3.
Third-party settlement acceleration: the attacker seeds custodian queues as above; later, independent bots observe available reserve and permissionlessly settle to the custodians, completing the drain into unrecoverable sinks without further attacker action.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Custodian queues have been seeded by prior attacker deficits
- (b). Mobilised reserves become available (e.g., after LiquidityAvailable events)
- (c). processSettlementFor is permissionless and callable by third parties
