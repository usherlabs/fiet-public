[Medium] Missing dispatch trigger on queue arrival in HubRSC under event-order inversion causes stalled reactive settlements

# Description

HubRSC only dispatches on [LiquidityAvailable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L404)/[MoreLiquidityAvailable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L418) and does not trigger dispatch on [SettlementQueuedReported](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L254) or persist liquidity credit. If LiquidityAvailable is processed before the corresponding queue addition becomes visible, [_dispatchLiquidity exits due to empty queues](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L431) and no follow-up callback is emitted. When the queue addition later arrives, it is recorded but not dispatched, stalling settlement until a subsequent liquidity event or manual processing.

HubRSC’s dispatch logic is event-driven on liquidity signals. When LiquidityAvailable is processed while HubRSC has no queued entries for the relevant LCC/underlying, [_dispatchLiquidity returns early (empty scan queue)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L431). Later, when [SettlementQueuedReported](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L254) for the same pair arrives via the longer SpokeRSC→HubCallback path, HubRSC only updates pending/queues and does not trigger dispatch or any follow-up callback. There is no stored “liquidity credit,” zero-batch retry logic does not run when the queue is empty, and [HubCallback’s MoreLiquidityAvailable is restricted to HubRSC-origin](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubCallback.sol#L148-L160). As a result, newly visible pending settlements can remain idle until another LiquidityAvailable/MoreLiquidityAvailable signal or a manual on-chain call to [LiquidityHub.processSettlementFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L920-L932) occurs. This is a liveness/scheduling deficiency; no funds are lost and accounting remains correct.

# Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [Medium] This causes a significant but temporary availability loss of reactive settlement automation; core settlement remains permissionless via processSettlementFor and no funds are lost.

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Medium] Requires a combination of plausible conditions (shortfall occurrence, empty queues at first liquidity signal, no immediate follow-up signal, and no manual settlement). Common but not universal.

# Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
Single-user unwrap shortfall: [LiquidityAvailable(lccX) is processed first](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L404) with no pending entries, so [_dispatchLiquidity returns immediately](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L431). [SettlementQueuedReported(lccX, user, shortfall)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L254) arrives later and is recorded but not dispatched. Settlement remains idle until a new liquidity signal or manual [processSettlementFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L920-L932).
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). An unwrap creates a shortfall for LCC-X (queued settlement will be emitted).
- (b). At the moment LiquidityAvailable is processed by HubRSC, there are no visible pending keys for LCC-X/underlying.
- (c). SettlementQueuedReported for the same pair arrives after the liquidity event (normal longer path).
- (d). No immediate subsequent liquidity signal occurs, and no manual processSettlementFor is called.

### Scenario 2.
Shared-underlying stall: [LiquidityAvailable(lccA, underlying) is processed](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L426-L431) when the shared-underlying and per-LCC queues are empty. _dispatchLiquidity falls back to per-LCC scan and returns early. Later, queue additions for LCC-A/LCC-B are recorded, but no dispatch occurs until another liquidity event or manual processing.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Two or more LCCs share the same underlying.
- (b). At the first LiquidityAvailable signal for one LCC, both the shared-underlying and the per-LCC queues are empty at HubRSC.
- (c). Queue additions for the LCCs arrive only after that first liquidity signal.
- (d). No immediate subsequent liquidity signal occurs, and no manual processSettlementFor is called.

### Scenario 3.
Low-cost griefing: An attacker [triggers a small unwrap](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/CanonicalVault.sol#L370-L378) to [emit LiquidityAvailable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L884-L896) just before a victim’s queue addition becomes visible to HubRSC. HubRSC processes the liquidity signal with empty queues and returns early ([empty-queue exit](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L431)). The victim’s later queue addition is recorded but not dispatched, increasing delay until a later signal or manual processing.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Periods of infrequent liquidity signals.
- (b). Attacker can trigger a small unwrap that emits LiquidityAvailable before the victim’s queue addition is visible to HubRSC.
- (c). At the liquidity signal time, HubRSC queues are empty for the relevant LCC/underlying.
- (d). No immediate subsequent liquidity signal occurs, and no manual processSettlementFor is called.

## [Medium] Contextless continuation and lane-global retry credits in HubRSC reactive dispatcher causes automated settlement stall

### Description

HubRSC’s [MoreLiquidityAvailable callbacks](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubCallback.sol#L159) do not carry scan context and rely on a [lane-global cursor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L439-L444) and [retry credits that are cleared on any non-zero batch](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L486-L516). Combined with [no rescan on settlement outcomes](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L288-L307), this can prematurely terminate automated dispatch while reserve remains, stalling until a new LiquidityAvailable occurs. [Manual settlement remains possible](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L931-L944).

HubRSC handles follow-ups via [MoreLiquidityAvailable(lcc, amount)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubCallback.sol#L159) which lacks lane/cursor/generation context. On receipt, it [recomputes the lane (shared-underlying vs per-LCC)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L427-L430) and [starts scanning from the lane’s mutable cursor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L439-L444). Zero-batch retry credits are [seeded only on LiquidityAvailable](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L396-L405) and are keyed by the current lane; [any non-zero batch on that lane clears the credits](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L486-L516). If a continuation encounters a zero-batch when credits are 0 (bootstrap false), no further callback is emitted, and because [SettlementProcessed/Failed callbacks do not trigger scans](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L288-L307), dispatch can stall even with usable reserve until a new LiquidityAvailable occurs. This is a liveness/availability issue for automated settlement, not a funds-safety issue, as permissionless manual settlement via [LiquidityHub.processSettlementFor](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/evm/src/LiquidityHub.sol#L931-L944) remains possible.

### Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [Medium] Significant but temporary availability loss of an important automated settlement subsystem; no principal loss and a permissionless manual workaround exists.

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Medium] Requires plausible interleavings and states (reserved-only windows, shared-underlying routing, out-of-order callbacks) that are realistic in active deployments; no attacker or trusted-role misuse required.

### Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
Shared-underlying continuation is interrupted by an interleaved non-zero batch: A LiquidityAvailable(A, L0) sets zero-batch credits and [emits a follow-up after a zero-batch window](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L486-L516); before the follow-up runs, LiquidityAvailable(B, L1) on the same underlying produces a non-zero batch that [clears the lane’s credits](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L486-L516); when the earlier follow-up executes and again encounters a zero-batch window, no further callback is emitted, stalling automation until a new LiquidityAvailable.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Shared-underlying lane populated (queueDataByUnderlying[underlying].size > 0).
- (b). Lane cursor positioned at a zero-batch window (entries have dispatchable == 0 due to in-flight reservations).
- (c). Interleaved LiquidityAvailable events across LCCs sharing the same underlying.
- (d). MoreLiquidityAvailable follow-up executes after a non-zero batch has cleared lane credits.

### Scenario 2.
Lane toggling clears credits and ends a per-LCC continuation: Initially only per-LCC queue for A is used and a zero-batch window seeds credits; underlying backfill later seeds the shared-underlying lane and [routing switches](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L584-L600); a non-zero batch on the shared lane [clears shared-lane credits](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L486-L516); when the original follow-up runs and hits a zero-batch, no further callbacks are scheduled, stalling automation.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Initially, shared-underlying lane empty; only per-LCC queue for A used.
- (b). A zero-batch window occurs on per-LCC lane for A, seeding credits.
- (c). Underlying backfill later seeds the shared-underlying lane causing routing to switch.
- (d). A non-zero batch on the shared lane clears credits before the original follow-up consumes them.

### Scenario 3.
Failure-driven release does not resume scanning after a terminal zero-batch: A follow-up runs with batchCount == 0, remainingLiquidity > 0, and credits == 0, so no further callback is emitted; later SettlementProcessed/Failed releases in-flight reservations and makes entries dispatchable, but HubRSC [does not schedule scans](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/cbac5017a6e67bb7f59c30dfcf35a5fb9142fb4c/contracts/reactive/src/HubRSC.sol#L288-L307) on these outcomes, so automation remains stalled until a new LiquidityAvailable.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). A follow-up scan returns batchCount == 0, remainingLiquidity > 0, and zero-batch retry credits == 0 (bootstrap false).
- (b). Subsequent SettlementProcessed/Failed events release in-flight reservations for head-of-queue entries.
- (c). No new LiquidityAvailable event arrives to re-seed credits.
