[High] Commit-local signal reuse and lack of nonce-based invalidation in VTSCommitLib/VTSLifecycleLinkedLib allow aggregate over-issuance causing protocol reserve drain

# Description

Commits store independent mmState snapshots and remain valid until their own expiry even after later VRL nonce advancements; add-liquidity checks compare per-position issuance only against the same commit’s signal value, with no per‑MM or per‑commit aggregate budget. This allows the same off-chain reserves to be counted multiple times across positions/commits, leading to undercollateralized exposure and principal drain from protocol reserves/coverage.

When a liquidity signal is committed, [VTSCommitLib._commitSignalInternal saves a copy of the MarketMaker state (mmState) and sets an expiresAt timestamp](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L326-L328). [VRLSignalManager enforces nonce monotonicity during verification (mmNonce)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/VRLSignalManager.sol#L136-L154), but VTS does not read mmNonce to invalidate or disqualify older commits. Liveness checks ([VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.isSignalValid](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.sol#L121-L146)) require only that the commit exists, is not expired (for live uses), and that mmState.owner != 0 and reserves are non-empty; they do not compare to the MM’s latest nonce. During MM add-liquidity, [VTSPositionMMOpsLib._handleLiquidityIncrease calls VTSCommitLib.validateLiquidityDelta](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSPositionMMOpsLib.sol#L418-L441), which verifies [issuedUsd for this position against signalUsd (from the same commit’s mmState)](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L461-L470) plus this position’s settledUsd ([VTSCommitLib.validateLiquidityDelta](https://github.com/usherlabs/fiet-protocol/blob/8cefc80d0a77f70260d5024395fd7d64d8747a8f/contracts/evm/src/libraries/VTSCommitLib.sol#L186-L201)). This per-position, per-commit-local check does not aggregate usage across other positions or across other commits of the same MM. As a result, the same off-chain reserves can be repeatedly reused to pass add-liquidity checks across multiple positions and multiple concurrent commits. Aggregate issuance/exposure can exceed the MM’s real reserves, producing larger Hub queues and deficits that are later serviced from market reserves and socialized coverage, causing direct principal losses to the protocol/market.

# Severity

**Impact Explanation:** [High] Aggregate over-issuance enables obligations (queues, deficits) that are later serviced by CanonicalVault/LiquidityHub from market reserves and socialized coverage, causing direct, material principal outflows and undercollateralization risk for the protocol/market.

**Likelihood Explanation:** [Medium] Exploitation requires being an MM and coordinating adds when in‑market reserves are available, but involves no oracle/admin failure or rare states; these are realistic operational conditions in active markets.

# Exploitation

## Exploitation Scenarios:

### Scenario 1.
Within a single commit, the MM opens multiple positions. Each position’s add-liquidity check independently compares its issuedUsd against the same commit-local signalUsd (plus its own settledUsd), allowing aggregate issuance across positions to exceed the single signalUsd reserve base; obligations later drain protocol reserves and coverage.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker is a market maker (MM) controlling an authorised router (MMPositionManager) and the commit’s advancer so VTSLifecycleLinkedLib.validateMMOperation passes.
- (b). A fresh commit exists: VRLSignalManager verified the signal; mmState.reserves non-empty; commit.expiresAt in the future.
- (c). OracleHelper provides accurate pricing (assumed).
- (d). Market vault has sufficient in‑market reserves to satisfy base VTS settlement required on add‑liquidity.

### Scenario 2.
Across multiple commits after nonce advancement, the MM first opens positions under C1 and later creates C2 (with a higher VRL nonce). Since older commits are not invalidated by nonce changes, positions under both C1 and C2 reuse independent commit-local signalUsd values, inflating aggregate exposure beyond real reserves and producing larger queues/deficits serviced by protocol reserves.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker is an MM with control of router/advancer for both commits.
- (b). Commit C1 exists and is still unexpired after C2 (with higher nonce) is created; VTS does not invalidate C1 on nonce advancement.
- (c). OracleHelper provides accurate pricing (assumed).
- (d). Market vault has sufficient in‑market reserves to satisfy base VTS settlement for opens under both commits at the times of adds.

### Scenario 3.
Rolling amplification under overlapping commit windows: the MM opens many positions under C1 and C2 while both are live. Each per-position check reuses the respective commit’s signalUsd, compounding aggregate over-issuance. As obligations are realized over time, market reserves and socialized coverage are consumed, imposing principal losses on the protocol/market.
#### Preconditions / Assumptions
- (a). Attacker is an MM; controls router/advancer; can create multiple positions across overlapping commit windows.
- (b). Multiple commits remain live concurrently due to their independent expiresAt; no mmNonce-based invalidation applies.
- (c). OracleHelper provides accurate pricing (assumed).
- (d). Market vault intermittently has sufficient in‑market reserves to permit repeated add‑liquidity base settlement over time.
