description: How to authenticate requests to the Fiet Business API.
---

## Authentication method

The Fiet Business API uses **HTTP Basic Authentication** (MVP). Credentials are issued per organisation and environment.

Include an `Authorization` header on every request:

- `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>`

## Environments

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Production (example) | `https://api.fiet.finance` |
| Sandbox | Coming soon |

## Example request

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>" \
  "https://api.fiet.finance/health"
```

## Error responses

Common responses you should handle:

- **401 Unauthorized**: missing or invalid credentials
- **403 Forbidden**: credentials are valid, but access is not permitted
- **400 Bad Request**: invalid parameters or request body (see `Problem` schema)

Where applicable, error responses follow an RFC 7807-style shape:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "string"
}
```
