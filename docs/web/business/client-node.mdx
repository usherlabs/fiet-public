description: Self-hosted execution-plane for signing and broadcasting transactions locally.

<Note>
  The Client Node is an optional, self-hosted component. It is not part of the
  initial core release.

## What is the Client Node?

The Client Node is a self-hosted service you run in your own infrastructure.

It mirrors the Business API’s `/v1/*` surface but adds an `executionMode` parameter:

- `executionMode=plan`: return instructions and plans only (no signing or broadcasting)
- `executionMode=execute`: fetch a plan from the Business API, then **sign and broadcast locally**, returning execution receipts

## Execution receipts

In `execute` mode, responses can include execution receipts such as:

- `status`
- `relayTransactionId`
- `txHash`

## Relay operator surface

The Client Node exposes `/relay/*` for operator-level operations such as:

- transaction lifecycle monitoring
- relayer management
- gas configuration
- message signing

## Configuration

The Client Node is designed as a single service with a single configuration file:

- Business API base URL and credentials
- local signing configuration and runtime settings

## Architecture preview

See [Architecture and workflows](/business/architecture) for how `plan` and `execute` modes fit into swap and payment flows.
