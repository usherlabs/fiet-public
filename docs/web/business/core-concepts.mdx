## Non-custodial posture

The Business API is **non-custodial infrastructure**:

- It **does not** sign transactions
- It **does not** broadcast transactions
- It has **no access** to your keys or customer funds

Instead, the API returns **derived data** (quotes) and **actionable outputs** (instructions and plans). You execute them using your own infrastructure (or the Client Node, coming soon).

## Quote semantics

`GET /v1/quote` returns a **derived** quote from current on-chain market state.

- Quotes are **not persisted** as entities.
- Responses include `asOf` provenance and an `expiresAt` time.
- Amounts are expressed as **strings in smallest units** to avoid floating-point issues.

Trade types:

- `EXACT_IN`: you specify the input amount; the response gives the output amount.
- `EXACT_OUT`: you specify the output amount; the response gives the required input amount.

## The instruction model

Swap and payment responses include ordered `instructions[]`. Each instruction represents an on-chain action to execute, including:

- **where** to call (`to`)
- **what** to call (`data`, calldata hex)
- **how much value** to send (`value`, wei as a string)
- **constraints** such as `notAfter` and `maxSlippageBps`

You sign and submit these instructions on-chain.

## Payment corridors

A **corridor** identifies a supported route for moving value from a source to a target (for example, `usdc-eth->aud-bank`). Corridors let you:

- validate what routes are available before creating a payment
- select the appropriate route for a customer or region

See [Markets](/business/endpoint/markets) for corridor discovery.

## Payment plans and steps

`POST /v1/payments` returns a **PaymentPlan**: an ordered list of steps with stable identifiers for reconciliation.

Common step types include:

- `AWAIT_DEPOSIT`
- `EXECUTE_SWAP` (includes `instructions[]`)
- `CUSTODIAN_PAYOUT` (includes a `custodianAction` envelope)
- `SEND_DIGITAL_COLLECT`

Each step has a lifecycle status such as `PENDING`, `READY`, `DONE`, or `FAILED`.

The request includes a `clientReference` so you can correlate plans to internal ERP/payment records.

## Digital Collect

When `options.mode=DIGITAL_COLLECT`, the payment includes a recipient collection experience:

- Your integration provides the recipient’s email address.
- The recipient receives an email with a link to the **Fiet-hosted Digital Collect UI**.
- In that UI, the recipient chooses how they want to receive funds, for example:
  - an **EVM wallet** (connect or paste an address)
  - a **bank account** (region-specific details)
  - an **eMoney wallet** (provider-specific identifier)
- Funds are delivered to the recipient’s selected destination.

This means you do **not** need to build a recipient-facing wallet/bank detail capture UI for collect flows.

## Error handling

Where applicable, errors follow an RFC 7807-style `Problem` shape:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "string"
}
```
