description: Discover supported chains, tokens, and payment corridors before quoting or creating payments.
---

## Overview

The Markets endpoints are read-only discovery tools. Use them to understand what the Business API supports before you request quotes or create payments.

## Chains

`GET /v1/markets/chains` returns supported EVM networks.

Use cases:

- populate a chain selector in your app
- validate a chainId before quoting

## Tokens

`GET /v1/markets/tokens` returns supported tokens, optionally filtered by `chainId`.

Each token includes:

- `chainId`
- token contract `address`
- `symbol`
- `decimals`

Use cases:

- populate token dropdowns
- validate token pairs for quoting and swaps
- display human-readable amounts (using `decimals`)

## Corridors

`GET /v1/markets/corridors` returns supported payment corridors (routes).

Corridors are referenced by `id` (for example, `usdc-eth->aud-bank`) and may include constraints and metadata needed to select the right route.

Use cases:

- determine which payout routes are available for a customer/region
- choose a corridorId when creating a payment plan
