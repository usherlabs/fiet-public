description: Fetch live derived quotes for swaps using EXACT_IN or EXACT_OUT semantics.

## Overview

A quote is a **derived** view of pricing based on current on-chain market state. Quotes are **ephemeral**:

- `GET /v1/quote` does not create or persist a quote entity.
- Responses include `asOf` provenance and an `expiresAt` timestamp.

## Trade types

- `**EXACT_IN**`: you specify the exact input amount; you receive the expected output amount.
- `**EXACT_OUT**`: you specify the exact output amount; you receive the required input amount.

Amounts are expressed as **strings in smallest units** (for example, USDC with 6 decimals).

## Reading the response

Key fields in the `Quote` response:

- `asOf`: provenance for the derived response (block reference and timestamp when available)
- `expiresAt`: how long the quote should be considered valid for planning
- `amountIn` / `amountOut`: smallest units as strings
- `fees`: breakdown (when available)
- `route`: routing details (implementation-defined)

## Example

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>" \
  "https://api.fiet.finance/v1/quote?chainId=1&tokenIn=0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48&tokenOut=0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2&tradeType=EXACT_IN&amount=1000000&slippageBps=50"
```
