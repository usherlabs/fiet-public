title: Swap
description: Generate swap instructions (calldata + constraints) for client-side execution.
---

## Overview

`POST /v1/swap` returns a **SwapPlan**:

- a fresh derived `quote`
- an ordered list of `instructions[]` to execute on-chain

The Business API produces instructions only. It does **not** sign or broadcast transactions.

## Request parameters

The request includes:

- `chainId`, `tokenIn`, `tokenOut`
- `tradeType` (`EXACT_IN` or `EXACT_OUT`)
- `amount` (smallest units as a string)
- `slippageBps` (basis points)

Optional fields may include:

- `recipient`: where swap outputs should be sent (if applicable)
- `deadline`: a time-bound constraint for execution

## Understanding the response

`SwapPlan.instructions[]` is an ordered list of EVM calls. Each instruction includes:

- `to`: contract address to call (typically a router)
- `data`: calldata hex
- `value`: wei to send (as a string)
- `constraints`: execution constraints such as `notAfter` and `maxSlippageBps`

In many same-chain swaps, `instructions[]` contains exactly one item. Future upgrades may return multiple instructions (for example, approval + swap).

## Who executes?

- **Direct integration (core):** you call the Business API and receive `instructions[]`. You sign and broadcast using your own wallet infrastructure.
- **Client Node (coming soon):** you call your self-hosted Client Node with `executionMode=execute`. It fetches the swap plan from the Business API, then signs and broadcasts locally, returning execution receipts (such as `txHash`).

See [Architecture and workflows](/business/architecture) for the end-to-end diagrams.

## Example

```bash
curl -sS \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "chainId": 1,
    "tokenIn": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    "tokenOut": "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2",
    "tradeType": "EXACT_IN",
    "amount": "1000000",
    "slippageBps": 50
  }' \
