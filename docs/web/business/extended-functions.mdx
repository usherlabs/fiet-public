## Recipients management

Create, list, and validate payment recipients (for example, bank accounts and wallets) so you can reuse verified recipient profiles across payments.

## Digital Collect endpoints

Programmatic Digital Collect support, including creating collect requests and tracking status over time (for example: created, sent, confirmed, expired, failed).

## Webhooks

Register webhook endpoints to receive events (for example, payment plan updates and collect completion) for near real-time automation and reconciliation.

## Reconciliation reports

Generate exports (CSV/JSON) for a date range and download the results once ready.
