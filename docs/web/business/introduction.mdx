## What is the Fiet Business API?

Discover markets, get live quotes, then obtain and execute on token swap or fiat payment instructions. Designed for fintechs and businesses integrating moving global currencies.

<Note>
  The Fiet Business API is **not yet publicly released**. Expect initial
  availability in **Q2 2026**. <br />
  **API design and documentation are subject to change.**
</Note>

The **Fiet Business API** gives businesses and fintechs a single hosted API surface for:

- **Discovering supported markets** (chains, tokens, corridors)
- **Fetching live derived quotes** from current on-chain state
- **Generating swap instructions** (calldata + constraints) for you to execute
- **Producing multi-step payment plans** for cross-border and off-ramp workflows
- **Sending Digital Collect requests** where recipients complete a short, Fiet-hosted collection flow

The Business API is **non-custodial infrastructure**:

- It **does not** sign transactions
- It **does not** broadcast transactions
- It has **no access** to your keys or customer funds

## Architecture at a glance

Fiet provides the **planning** (quotes, instructions, plans). **You** control **execution** (signing and broadcasting), either with your own wallet infrastructure or via the **Client Node** (coming soon).
