title: Liquidity Commitment Certificates
---

Liquidity Commitment Certificates (LCCs) are protocol-bound non-transferable assets in the Fiet Protocol that represent market makers’ verified reserve liquidity (VRL) committed to trading pools. Traded only in Fiet’s integrated DEXs, LCCs enable low-slippage swaps while keeping market makers’ reserves flexible.

## How LCCs Work

Market makers commit VRL to a Fiet Market, creating LCCs (e.g., lcc-USDC for USDC, lcc-ETH for ETH, lcc-AUDD for AUDD, etc.) that represent on-chain collateral (e.g., 2% of the commitment) and verified reserves. Traders use LCCs to swap assets in the DEX and can redeem them for the underlying currency when needed. LCCs are protocol-bound, ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Traditional Finance Analogy

LCCs are a hybrid of a *standby letter of credit* and a *warehouse receipt*. In traditional finance, a standby letter of credit is a bank’s promise to cover funds if a seller cannot deliver, providing buyer confidence. A warehouse receipt proves ownership of stored goods, like grain, tradable in markets. Similarly, LCCs use zkTLS to verify reserve liquidity (e.g., USDC in a bank), ensuring availability without moving funds on-chain. Traders can trade LCCs like receipts, accessing liquidity with the trust of a bank-backed guarantee.

<Tip>
LCCs let traders tap into verified liquidity, like trading a receipt for stored goods, without locking funds.

## User Experience

Fiet integrates with next-generation AMMs like Uniswap v4 to abstract LCCs from users. **Proxy pools** route trades from standard asset pairs (e.g., USDC/AUDD) to LCC-based pools (e.g., lcc-USDC/lcc-AUDD), simplifying the user experience. For larger trades, if settled liquidity is insufficient, LCCs may temporarily appear in a trader’s wallet until market makers deliver the underlying capital, which automatically replaces the LCCs.

<Note>
Proxy pools make LCCs invisible to users where possible, but large trades may show LCCs briefly until settlement.

## Key Features

- **Fungibility**: LCCs for the same currency (e.g., Icc-USDC) are interchangeable.
- **Collateralisation**: A small on-chain deposit secures commitments.
- **Non-Transferable**: LCCs are restricted to Fiet’s DEX.
- **Automatic Creation**: Committing VRL instantly generates LCCs.

<Note>
LCCs are distinct from stablecoins, designed as bookkeeping units for Fiet’s integrated DEXs.
