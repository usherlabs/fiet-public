Fiet is a decentralised liquidity commitments protocol that transforms decentralised finance (DeFi) by enabling market makers to provide liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs) without locking funds on-chain. Using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS), Fiet verifies liquidity held in banks, exchanges, or wallets, creating deeper, more cost-efficient markets for trading, foreign exchange, and real-world assets.

## Why Fiet?

DeFi markets often face liquidity challenges, leading to high slippage and costly trading. Fiet solves this by allowing market makers to commit **verified reserve liquidity** — funds held off-chain or on-chain without locking them in AMM pools. Through instruments, *akin to a hybrid standby letter of credit and warehouse receipt*, ensures traders access deep liquidity while market makers retain flexibility.

- **For Traders**: Enjoy low-cost, low-slippage trading in markets like local stablecoins (e.g., AUD, BRL) or tokenised RWAs (real estate, private credit, etc.).
- **For Market Makers**: Commit dynamic liquidity now, settle later — earning fees without capital lockup or impermanent loss risks.
- **For DeFi Ecosystems**: Enable totally new and lower cost liquid markets without bootstrapping retail liquidity with absurd incentives and requiring upfront total value locked (TVL).

## How It Works

Fiet integrates traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi through a simple, secure process:

1. **Liquidity Verification**: Market makers use zkTLS to verify reserves in banks or exchanges, ensuring trust without exposing sensitive data.
2. **Liquidity Commitment Certificates (LCCs)**: Protocol-bound non-transferable tokens represent committed liquidity, traded only in Fiet’s integrated decentralised exchanges (DEXs).
3. **Dynamic Settlements**: Liquidity is settled on-chain only when market demand requires it, guided by the Value-to-Signal (VTS) model.
4. **Guaranteed Continuity**: Settlement Guarantors step in if market makers fail to deliver, ensuring market stability.

<Note>
Fiet is built on Arbitrum, with plans for cross-chain expansion, making it accessible across DeFi ecosystems.
