## Protocol Architecture

The Fiet Protocol is built on a sophisticated architecture that seamlessly bridges traditional finance and decentralised finance (DeFi). This page provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol's architectural components, data flows, and system interactions.

Fiet's architecture is designed around three primary pillars: **verification**, **commitment**, and **settlement**. The protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS) to verify off-chain liquidity while maintaining privacy and security.

## Commitments Architecture

Liquidity Commitment Certificates (LCCs) form the backbone of Fiet's liquidity infrastructure. This architecture shows how commitments are created, verified, and managed:

## Liquidity Flow

Understanding how liquidity flows through the protocol is crucial for participants. This annotated diagram shows the complete liquidity lifecycle:

## Participant Workflows

### Market Makers

Market makers follow a specific sequence to provide liquidity to the protocol:

### Traders

Traders interact with the protocol through a streamlined process:

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. **Zero-Knowledge Verification**
- Uses zkTLS to verify liquidity without exposing sensitive financial data
- Maintains privacy while ensuring trust and transparency
- Enables verification of off-chain assets

### 2. **Dynamic Liquidity Management**
- Liquidity is committed but not locked until settlement
- Market makers retain flexibility while providing market depth
- Settlement occurs only when market demand requires it

### 3. **Guaranteed Continuity**
- Settlement Guarantors ensure market stability
- Automatic fallback mechanisms prevent market disruption
- Risk mitigation through multiple layers of protection

### 4. **Scalable Infrastructure**
- Built on Arbitrum for cost efficiency and speed
- Designed for cross-chain expansion
- Modular architecture supports future enhancements

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Arbitrum (with cross-chain expansion planned)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Usher Labs' Verity zkTLS for liquidity verification
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity- and Rust-based protocol logic
- **Oracle Integration**: Real-time market data and settlement triggers
- **DEX Integration**: Seamless trading through integrated decentralised exchanges

## Security Architecture

The protocol implements multiple security layers:

1. **Cryptographic Security**: zkTLS ensures mathematical proof of liquidity
2. **Smart Contract Security**: Audited contracts (pending formal verification)
3. **Economic Security**: Settlement guarantees and risk management
4. **Operational Security**: Cryptography infrastructure for secure controls and governance mechanisms

<Note>
The Fiet Protocol architecture is designed to be both secure and scalable, enabling the creation of deep, liquid markets while maintaining the flexibility and efficiency that participants require.
