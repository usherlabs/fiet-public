title: Technical Specification (Pre-Whitepaper)
description: Explore the detailed mechanics of the Fiet Protocol through its technical specification.
---

The Fiet Technical Specification is a **pre-whitepaper**, a comprehensive document detailing the Fiet Protocol’s mechanics, designed for developers, researchers, and technical enthusiasts.  

Unlike the high-level summaries in these public docs, the specification dives into intricate details, including mathematical formulas (e.g., VTS calculations), cryptographic implementations (e.g., zkTLS proofs), and smart contract logic for AMM integration, settlements, and rewards.

## Get access

To access the technical specification, please [contact us in Discord](https://go.usher.so/discord).

## What It Covers

The specification spans:
- **Protocol Mechanics**: In-depth VRL, LCC, and VTS model operations.
- **Cryptography**: Verity’s zkTLS for liquidity verification.
- **Settlement Processes**: RfS triggers, guarantor seizures, and risk management.
- **Rewards System**: Upcoming FIET token distribution and Reward mechanics.
- **Implementation Details**: Smart contract and oracle integrations.

These provide a deeper understanding than the public documentation’s simplified explanations, catering to those building or analysing Fiet.
