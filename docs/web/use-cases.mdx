description: Explore how the Fiet Protocol enables cost-efficient trading and new markets in DeFi.
---

The Fiet Protocol powers innovative financial applications by bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralised finance (DeFi). By allowing market makers to commit verified liquidity without locking funds, Fiet creates deeper, more efficient markets for trading, foreign exchange, and real-world assets. Below are key use cases demonstrating Fiet’s impact across DeFi ecosystems.

Fiet enables low-cost, high-liquidity markets for local stablecoins, real-world assets, and emerging blockchains.

## On-Chain Foreign Exchange (FX)

Fiet facilitates cost-efficient trading of local stablecoins (e.g., AUD, BRL, CAD) against major cryptocurrencies like USDC. Unlike traditional AMM pools, which suffer from shallow liquidity and high slippage, Fiet allows market makers to commit USD-denominated reserves verified via zkTLS. For example, in an AUDD/USDC pool, market makers settle AUDD only when demand arises, enabling low-cost FX that competes with traditional banking systems.

<Tip>
Fiet’s FX markets can capture a share of the $903 billion annual remittance market by offering cheaper conversions.

## Real-World Asset (RWA) Markets

Tokenised assets like real estate or commodities often face liquidity challenges in DeFi. Fiet enables issuers to lend RWAs to market makers, who commit verified USDC reserves to create liquid markets (e.g., HOUSE/USDC). This preserves RWA capitalisation while enabling trading and collateralisation in lending protocols, without requiring issuers to fractionalise their investments.

## High-Volume, Low-Cost Markets

For popular trading pairs like USDC/ETH, Fiet reduces fees by allowing market makers to commit the same verified liquidity across multiple markets. This capital efficiency lowers costs for traders, as they no longer compensate for locked liquidity. The result is deeper, more competitive markets for high-demand assets.

## Emerging Blockchains

Emerging blockchains struggle to attract total value locked (TVL) for liquid AMM markets. Fiet’s virtual liquidity model enables low-slippage trading without requiring large on-chain deposits. This fosters DeFi adoption on new chains, supporting innovative assets and cross-chain ecosystems.

Fiet’s use cases are powered by Usher Labs’ Verity zkTLS, ensuring secure and private liquidity verification.
